# RAF-News

This is a university project of a full-stack website for managing news. It has a dedicated CMS for two types of users (Admin/Content-Creator). 
Both Admins and Content-Creators can add News, Categories (which have News), update them, delete them. The difference between this two users is that Admins
can also do these operations on Users.<br>
<br>
Admins can also deactive certain CMS users (not other admins). <br>
<br>
The full documentation is in the "Web programiranje.docx" file.
<br>
The back-end of this page was made using java, JAX-RS with a TomCat server.<br>
The front-end was made in Vue 2 with the help of Bootstrap.<br>
